> ### Movie Description
> The show takes place in the 1980s, with the central focus being the fictional town of Hawkins, Indiana. The first season, set in November 1983, follows numerous groups of characters as they separately investigate the disappearance of Will Byers. The subsequent second and third seasons expand the narrative scope, exploring the complex fallout from the events of November 1983. The fourth season further expands the show's scope, with major storylines taking place outside of Hawkins for the first time. A fifth season is in the works and is set to conclude the series. Two spin-off series - a live-action series and an animated series - are apparently in development.
